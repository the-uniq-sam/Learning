# Java Learning Roadmap (Visual & Actionable)

🎯 Goal: Turn the original plan into a quick-reference, visual roadmap with checklists, timeline, sample projects and study tips.


---

## Roadmap Overview (Phases)
| Phase | Focus | Duration (suggested) | Visual Cue |
|------:|:------|:--------------------:|:-----------|
| Foundation | Syntax, OOP, Exceptions, File I/O | 2–4 weeks | 🔰 |
| Intermediate | Collections, Generics, Concurrency, JVM | 3–5 weeks | 🧰 |
| Advanced | Reflection, Streams, Lambdas, Networking, Patterns | 4–6 weeks | 🧠 |
| Modern | Java 8+ features, Records, Virtual Threads, System Design | 2–4 weeks | 🚀 |
| Practice | Projects, LLD, Interview Qs, System Design | ongoing | 🛠️ |

## Phase Cards (Checklist style)

### 1) Foundation 🔰 (Core)
- [ ] Java syntax: variables, types, operators
- [ ] Control flow: if/switch, loops
- [ ] Methods & OOP basics: class, object, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- [ ] Exceptions: try/catch/finally, custom exceptions
- [ ] File I/O & NIO basics, serialization
Estimated: 2–4 weeks  
Starter project: CLI contact manager (file persistence)

### 2) Intermediate 🧰
- [ ] Collections: List/Set/Map/Queue + common implementations
- [ ] Generics & type system
- [ ] Multithreading: Thread, Runnable, Executors
- [ ] Concurrency tools: synchronized, volatile, locks, Atomic*
- [ ] JVM: GC basics, memory layout, classloading
Estimated: 3–5 weeks  
Starter project: Threaded web-crawler or in-memory cache

### 3) Advanced 🧠
- [ ] Streams API & Lambdas
- [ ] Reflection & annotation usage
- [ ] Networking: sockets, basic HTTP client/server
- [ ] Design patterns: Factory, Singleton, Strategy, Observer
Estimated: 4–6 weeks  
Starter project: REST API + plugin system (Reflection)

### 4) Modern & System Design 🚀
- [ ] Java 8+ modern APIs (Optional, Date/Time)
- [ ] Records, sealed classes
- [ ] Virtual Threads & structured concurrency (Java 19+)
- [ ] Basic system design concepts (scalability, caching, rate limiting)
Estimated: 2–4 weeks  
Starter project: Microservice prototype with async processing

### 5) Practice & Interviews 🛠️
- [ ] Build 2–3 end-to-end projects
- [ ] Low-Level Design problems (class diagrams, interfaces)
- [ ] Mock interviews & company-specific Qs
- [ ] Advanced DSA refreshing for SDE2
Ongoing — keep a 2-week rotation to revise topics

## Visual Timeline (example)
- Month 1: Foundation + small project
- Month 2: Collections + Concurrency + project
- Month 3: Streams, Reflection, Patterns
- Month 4: Modern Java features + System Design
- Ongoing: Projects, LLD, Interviews

---

## Study Tips (quick)
- Timebox learning: 45–90 minute focused sessions.
- Build one small project per phase.
- Add Git commits with clear messages; create issues for tasks.
- Write 10–20 flashcard Qs after each phase.
- Pair-program or do mock interviews monthly.

---

## Suggested Projects Matrix
- Foundation: CLI Contact Manager (file storage)
- Intermediate: Concurrent Web Crawler / Cache
- Advanced: Plugin-based REST API (Reflection + Streams)
- Modern: Microservice with virtual threads + performance test
- Practice: End-to-end system design + interview walkthrough

---

## Resources (compact)
- Official Java Tutorials (Oracle)
- "Effective Java" (recommended chapters)
- Online courses: Java 8+, Concurrency deep-dive
- Tools: IntelliJ or VSCode + Maven/Gradle + JUnit
